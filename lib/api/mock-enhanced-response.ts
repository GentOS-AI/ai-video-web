  script: `Opening with a dramatic close-up of the sleek wireless headphones, camera slowly pulls back revealing the premium matte black finish with subtle gold accents. Soft studio lighting creates elegant reflections across the curved ear cups, emphasizing the luxurious texture.

The headphones rotate smoothly 360Â°, showcasing the ergonomic design and premium materials. Quick cut to detail shots: the precision-engineered hinges, the plush memory foam ear cushions, and the intuitive touch controls seamlessly integrated into the surface.

Transition to a lifestyle shot - the headphones worn by a young professional in a modern workspace, demonstrating the active noise cancellation as the busy environment fades to silence. The LED indicator pulses gently, signaling the ANC activation.

Final shot frames the headphones against a minimalist backdrop, floating gracefully with a subtle glow effect. The brand logo appears with understated elegance. Modern, sophisticated aesthetic throughout with emphasis on premium quality and technological innovation.`,
